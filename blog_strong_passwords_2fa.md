**The problem:** Many accounts are stolen because passwords are short or reused.

**The fix:** Use a long passphrase and add two‑factor authentication (2FA).

### 1) Make a long passphrase
Pick three or four random words you can picture together. Example: `violet-sunflower-train-sundae`. Avoid personal info.

### 2) Use a password manager
A password manager remembers for you so you don't have to. It can also create unique passwords for every site.

### 3) Turn on 2FA
Two‑factor adds a second step when you sign in. The best option for most people is an authenticator app.

> If a site ever asks for a one‑time code you didn't request, do not approve it.

**Takeaway:** Long, unique passwords + 2FA = much safer accounts.
